    <h1 class="text-2xl text-white font-bold">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I’m Michael, a software engineer and the founder of <a href="https://www.galahadcreative.com" class="text-teal-500">Galahad Creative</a>. I make games and software, with a focus on keeping things simple, scalable, and enjoyable to use.

    <h1 class="text-2xl text-white font-bold">Background</h1>

    <p>
        My background is rooted in software development,
        and I also build games using the same web technologies, so my work sits much closer to software engineering
        than traditional game development. Most of what I ship lives in that overlap.

    <p>
        The name GalahadXVI comes from an old username choice where earlier Galahad variations were already taken, so I jumped ahead to XVI and stuck with it.
        I have a strong interest in machine learning, enjoy staying active in the gym, and follow Sunderland AFC with the kind of optimism only a long-time supporter can maintain.
