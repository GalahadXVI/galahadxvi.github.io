    <h1 class="text-2xl text-white font-bold">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Michael Dawson, Software Engineer and Director for Galahad Creative. I'm not a big
        fan of writing about myself so I'll try to stick to just the essentials.

        History

            2008 - 2016

    </h1>
    <p>
        My journey started in 2008 after obsessively playing PBBG's (Persistant browser-based games)
         - namely the ol' classics such as Torn, GangsterRPG, Boredest and SoulRaider.
    </p>

    <p> 
        I decided to dive into game development and soon stumbled upon a PHP game engine called 'MCCodes,' 
        popular for powering numerous games at that time. I ended up making a game and selling it for 50 quid
        worth of Microsoft Points. Not too shabby, eh?
    </p>

    <p> 
        Following that experience, I ventured into a diverse array of software projects. My journey took me 
        through everything from game development to fitness tracking apps, and even cryptocurrency faucets.
        While at university, I dedicated my dissertation to developing a search engine, complete with a 
        unique algorithm I designed myself.

        SimpleMMO
        <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-green-500/10 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium text-green-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-green-500/20">
            2017 - Present
        </span>
    </h1>

    <p>
        Back in 2017, I dove into creating SimpleMMO, a game that filled a void in the mobile PBBG 
        (Persistent Browser-Based Game) scene. It started as a fun project to get to grips with the Laravel 
        framework and, honestly, the initial code was extremely rough (some of it's still in there). 
        After a casual launch on the Google Play Store, the game unexpectedly took off, getting 50 
        downloads in a few days. Over time, I kept adding to it in my spare time, purely as a hobby.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then 2020 hit, and COVID-19 changed everything. Gaming boomed during the lockdowns, and SimpleMMO 
        was no exception, with downloads jumping from 60 to 6,000 a day. This sudden surge pushed me to 
        upscale the gameâ€™s server resources massively. The growth was so immense that I left my regular 
        job to focus on my company, Galahad Creative Limited. SimpleMMO has since hit over a million players, 
        a huge achievement despite the game's shaky codebase. There have been a lot of challenges, for sure, 
        but I'll dive more into that in an upcoming blog post.

        Galahad Creative was founded with one guiding principle: simplicity. This philosophy is the heartbeat 
        of our operation. Whenever we develop something, our top priority is ensuring it's straightforward, 
        stylish, and a breeze to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Galahad Creative's inception, we've evolved from a solo venture to a dynamic team. We diversified 
        into various software sectors beyond just gaming. In early 2023, we unveiled 'Smashr,' a cutting-edge 
        issue tracking tool. It's designed for businesses to share their issue trackers with the public. 
        Wrapping up the year, we launched 'IdleMMO.' The game has already surpassed our initial projections 
        and gaining impressive momentum.

    <h1 class="text-2xl text-white font-bold">Interests</h1>

    <p>
        Apart from my focus on software development, I'm deeply fascinated by Machine Learning and its 
        intricate mechanics. Beyond the AI modules I've tackled in university, I've ventured into the realm of 
        neural networks, primarily using Python. Additionally, I've been experimenting with OpenAI's GPT models, 
        exploring their capabilities and nuances.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of tech, I like to indulge in my masochistic tendencies by watching my local football 
        team, Sunderland AFC.

    <h1 class="text-2xl text-white font-bold">Why GalahadXVI (Galahad Sixteen)?</h1>

    <p>
        While setting up my username on a gaming platform, I found that 'Galahad I' all the way up to 'Galahad VI' 
        were already claimed. In a moment of laziness, I chose not to follow the sequence and jumped ahead, 
        landing on 'Galahad XVI'. Thus 'Galahad XVI' was born and is used on all of my pseudonyms.
